        <p> It is a <i>Silog</i> meal where the main kicker is the <i>Sisig</i> dish, words combined together and we get <i>Sisilog</i>. What is silog?  Silog is a portmanteau of its two components: <i>Sinangag</i> (garlic fried rice) and <i>itlog</i> (egg). While the sisig dish is a Filipino dish consumed either as a appetizer or as the main dish itself. It's made from pork jowl and ears (maskara), pork belly, and chicken liver which is usually seasoned with calamansi, onions, and chili peppers. It originates from the Pampanga region in Luzon.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>The best way to enjoy sisig is with a cup of warm white rice on the side, as it may also be served as a main dish. Pulutan and sisig are synonymous terms. It refers to combining foods with beer or other alcoholic beverage. It goes well with wine or beer in my opinion.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>The extreme flavor and spice the Sisig have is best paired with the blandness of a sunny side up egg and the garlic fried rice, perfect for any meal of the day, usually consumed as breakfast by the Filipinos.</p>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>Lomi or Batangas Lomi is a popular dish in the Philippines, at least in the eastern region of Batangas, made using a variety of thick fresh egg noodles that have been soaked in lye water to give them more texture. There are as many ways to prepare lomi as there are restaurants, panciterias, or eateries that serve it. As a result, variations in recipes and quality are fairly prevalent.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="hidden">
        <p>There are a lot of unexquisite variations of noodle dishes or <i>Pancit</i> in the Philippines but Lomi is quite the one you're gonna crave for, especially on cold seasons or places in the Philippines with cold weather.</p>

        <p>Also known as <i>Adobong Manok</i> in tagalog, is a delightful dish of soft braised chicken with a savory, acidic, garlicky soy vinegar sauce made from common ingredients.

        <p>As a result of being seared, simmered in a tangy, delicious adobo sauce, and rendered chicken fat, this grilled chicken is incredibly juicy and soft. This dish's distinctive savory, acidic, garlicky flavor comes from the soy and vinegar sauce combined with black peppercorns, onion, and garlic. Don't forget to top your rice with the remaining sauce from the finished dish; it goes great with it. </p>

        <p> A popular on-the-go cheap Filipino meal consisting of beef stew, beef broth, and rice is known as pares. The stew, which features beef chunks cooked slowly in a delicious stock flavored with sugar, star anise, soy sauce, garlic, and other seasonings, is the dish's centerpiece. The spice-coated, perfectly tenderized beef brisket cubes. Even just the scent of this meal is appealing. The flavor is alluring. After tasting it, you will undoubtedly ask for more. I was first introduced to this dish during my Senior High School years. </p>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>Thanks to the flavorful broth and well-seasoned meat, a decent bowl of beef pares always tastes like a pleasure. The most flavorful and savory dish is created by the excellent combination of soy sauce, star anise, and black pepper.</p>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>It was in a local Pares on a cart selling various toppings other than beef for their Pares, with unlimited rice and Pares soup, costing me only P45-P60 pesos ($1 as of 2023) roaming in the streets of Trece Martires City, Cavite. During those days, this was a new addition to my top go-to meal whenever im very hungry. It's the cheapest deal for a rice meal for me. I instantly became a believer.</p>

            5. Dinuguan at Puto

        <p>Most Filipinos regard dinuguan and puto to be a nice supper pairing. This is a reference to steamed rice cakes and hog blood stew. The onions and garlic are sautéed with the pork. Pork blood, vinegar, and water are then added, and the mixture is heated until it is nicely thick. It is best consumed by dipping <i>(or scooping)</i> steamed rice cake, or what is known as puto in Filipino, into the blood stew and then indulging in both at once.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>As for the Dinuguan, despite of its unique exotic trait as using pork blood, the taste speaks otherwise. It has a distinct pig flavor and is flavorful, not overly salty, and frequently has a sour undertone. There is no getting around the fact that dinuguan is a staple in Manila and must be tried by any foreigner who wants to sample other Filipino cuisine than balut. This meal has a broad range of textures, from a very thin, light brown dish to a thick, black, gritty stew that Filipinos playfully call <i>"chocolate soup"</i>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="hidden">
        <p>To bland the extreme flavor of the dish, you can do it with rice, but we are here for the "better" option which is the Puto, a Filipino rice cake, regularly eaten for breakfast, dessert, or a snack. Rice is used to make the product, which is then crushed up and combined with sugar and coconut milk. The batter that results is next fermented for a number of hours, during which acidity and leavening take place. Dipping it to dinuguan is the best combination of tase balancing from salty-sour, to sweet and perfection.</p>
