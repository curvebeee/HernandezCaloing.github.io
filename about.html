        <p>Either you're a tourist newbie here in the Philippines or just a broke local, we always want stomach warmers and hunger reducing meals that won't leave our budget dehydrated at the end of the day. As saying goes, <i>"The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach"</i>. This food blog is what the title speak's for itself. Filipino dishes that cost as cheap as $3 or low (approximiately â‚±165 as of February 15, 2022), either as a homemade dish or in a go-to restaurant's and/or food stalls. On this website, we list the top 5 famous heavy dishes we can find, ranked them by their taste quality. Just like what they said, Filipino food is good food. Speaking of <i>"Filipino food"</i>, The Philippines' food scene is occasionally overshadowed by its neighbors to the northwest, Thailand and Vietnam. But, the Philippines can more than hold its own on the world culinary stage and even placed second in a CNN reader poll conducted in 2015 asking readers to name their preferred country for food travel. Filipino cuisine is diverse and excellent, with dishes ranging from the popular adobo to the exotic side of balut. In fact, Anthony Bourdain asserted that the Philippines had the greatest pork he had ever eaten. Ironically agreeing, porks are somehow in almost every pinoy dish you can see on this website, yet you would definitely crave for more instead of getting sated.</p>
